# Hatchify

Hatchify is a web application framework designed to accelerate the development of CRUD applications. If all you need is basic app, Hatchify can provide you with a fully functional system straight from a datatype schema. If you have more specialized requirements, Hatchify makes it easy to customize every part of the application to meet your needs.

Hatchify is structured as a number of modular libraries that can be consumed individually to use as much, or as little, as you require. Hatchify provides the speed of low-code development and the extensibility of custom code.

## Getting Started

In just a few short steps we will set up a project containing a Hatchify frontend and backend. Our frontend will use [React](https://react.dev/) and [MUI](https://mui.com/), and our backend will be using [Koa](https://koajs.com/). The project also uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a dev server which handles much of the React configuration for us.

> ‚úèÔ∏è Perform all the following steps:
>
> **Note:** The ‚úèÔ∏è icon indicates when to follow along!

1. Ensure you‚Äôre using [node 18 and npm 9 or above](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. Create a new project:

   ```bash
   npm init @hatchifyjs@latest
   ```

   - For the backend prompt answer: "Koa"
   - For the database prompt answer: "SQLite"

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Navigate to the Hatchify welcome screen:

Congrats, you‚Äôve got a seed of something great started!

### Schemas

Hatchify‚Äôs schemas define your data structure fields and relationships. We share these schemas across our backend and frontend to create database tables, generate REST endpoints, and create React components and data fetchers. Because these schemas are the backbone of our frontend and backend, we will place them in the empty schemas.ts file at the root directory of our project.

> ‚úèÔ∏è Update `schemas.ts` file with the following:

```ts
// hatchify-app/schemas.ts
import { belongsTo, boolean, dateonly, integer, hasMany, string } from "@hatchifyjs/core"
import type { PartialSchema } from "@hatchifyjs/core"

export const Todo = {
  name: "Todo", // üëÄ
  attributes: {
    name: string({ required: true }), // üëÄ
    dueDate: dateonly(),
    importance: integer(),
    complete: boolean({ default: false }),
  },
  relationships: {
    user: belongsTo("User"), // üëÄ
  },
} satisfies PartialSchema

export const User = {
  name: "User",
  attributes: {
    name: string({ required: true }),
  },
  relationships: {
    todos: hasMany("Todo"), // üëÄ
  },
} satisfies PartialSchema
```

As soon as you save this change, the app will automatically reload to include the new data types you've added:

<img width="1289" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-06 at 10 35 58‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/bitovi/hatchify/assets/9858612/e6f00fcb-ef76-4509-9a04-065f5548951f">

This defines a `Todo` and `User` type, each with some attributes. It also creates a relationship where a Todo `belongsTo` a User, and each user `hasMany` Todos.

You can refer to [our documentation](/docs/schema/README.md) for more information on how to define schemas.

### Seed Data

Hatchify doesn‚Äôt currently generate forms (though we are working on it!). To add data, you can use the REST APIs that Hatchify‚Äôs middleware provides.

# Seeding Sample Data

> ‚úèÔ∏è Run the following commands to create some sample data.

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/todos' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' \
--data '{
  "data": {
    "type": "Todo",
    "attributes": {
      "id": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-000000000002",
      "name": "Walk the dog",
      "dueDate": "2024-12-12",
      "importance": 6
    }
  }
}'

curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/todos' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' \
--data '{
  "data": {
    "type": "Todo",
    "attributes": {
      "id": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-000000000003",
      "name": "Laundry",
      "dueDate": "2024-12-02",
      "importance": 1
    }
  }
}'

curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/todos' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' \
--data '{
  "data": {
    "type": "Todo",
    "attributes": {
      "id": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-000000000004",
      "name": "Making Calls",
      "dueDate": "2024-12-31",
      "importance": 7
    }
  }
}'

curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/users' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' \
--data '{
  "data": {
    "type": "User",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "John Doe"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "todos": {
        "data": [
          {
            "type": "Todo",
            "id": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-000000000002"
          },
          {
            "type": "Todo",
            "id": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-000000000004"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}'

curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/users' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' \
--data '{
  "data": {
    "type": "User",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Jane Doe"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "todos": {
        "data": [
          {
            "type": "Todo",
            "id": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-000000000003"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

With some data in place, we can now further review the project.

### Interact with the UI

Now that data has been seeded the UI should look like:

You can start using this basic app to sort & filter the data:

## Trying Hatchify Online

You can try Hatchify online on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/bitovi/hatchify/tree/main/example/getting-started?file=schemas.ts&terminal=dev). It runs the Hatchify-based build setup directly in the browser, so it is almost identical to the local setup but doesn't require installing anything on your machine.
