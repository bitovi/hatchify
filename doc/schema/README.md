Hatchify provides its own interface for defining description of your data, called "schemas". The documentation for this interface is split into the following sections:

- [Attributes](./attribute-types/README.md)
  - API documentation for possible datatype attributes
- [Relationships](./relationship-types/README.md)
  - API documentation for possible schema relationship types
- [Naming](./naming.md)
  - Documentation describing the relationship between the names in the schema and the resulting tables, API services, & UI.
